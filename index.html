                    <h2>A Message from the President <em>A Call to the Community</em></h2>
                    <div class="precoldot5 col2">
                      <h3>A Look Back:<br/>Celebrating 50 Years</h3>
                      <p>On September 24, 1962, the first incoming class of Onondaga Community College students arrived at the Midtown Plaza campus in Syracuse. Despite cramped quarters, students, faculty and staff were passionate about the mission of the "community's college" and its promise of educational opportunity for everyone. That same passion is evident today as we continue to honor and build upon the strong foundation of educational excellence laid by those who came before us.</p>
                      <p>Onondaga has earned a national reputation for its commitment to academic excellence and innovation. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Education selected Onondaga for its national Quantway initiative, University Business magazine named OCC a 2010 Model of Efficiency, and in 2011 the Aspen Institute named OCC among the top 10 percent of community colleges in the nation.</p>
                      <p>Since its inception in 1980, the OCC Foundation has advanced Onondaga's mission by connecting with alumni, individual donors, corporations, and philanthropic organizations who are committed to open-door, public higher education as a primary avenue for individual and community development. Thanks to their outpouring of support, the Reach Beyond campaign has generated over $7 million to date to support scholarships, the Children's Learning Center, the SRC Arena and Events Center, and professional development.</p>
                      <h3>Challenges Ahead</h3>
                      <p>Maintaining pathways of opportunity for local citizens, and contributing to regional economic and community development is OCC's primary challenge for the future. Succeeding in this endeavor is more important than ever. In recognition of the growing link between economic competitiveness and college degree completion, the Lumina Foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and other organizations have called for a dramatic increase in national college degree and credential attainment. And a recent report by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce predicts the U.S. will need three million more college graduates by 2018 to meet workforce demand.</p>
                      <p>Community colleges are being called upon to help meet this national challenge at the regional level - community by community - by working with school districts, employers, non-profits, and local governments. Onondaga Community College is committed to answering this call.</p>

                      <h3>Planning for the Future</h3>
                      <p>Last year, ideas and feedback from area employers, local citizens, alumni, students, and employees informed the development of OCC's 2011-2016 Strategic Plan, A Framework for Success. The plan includes aggressive goals focused on:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Increasing the number of students who successfully complete a degree or credential,</li>
                        <li>Strengthening the pipeline from secondary to post-secondary education,</li>
                        <li>Strengthening educational pathways from the associate's to the baccalaureate level,</li>
                        <li>Strengthening career pathways to the workforce, and</li>
                        <li>Achieving financial sustainability to protect the College's core mission and maintain its high quality.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>And, most of all, OCC remains committed to providing all students the opportunity to explore their interests, discover their talents and transform their lives - a promise that is, has been, and will always be Onondaga's hallmark.</p>
                      <p>I invite you to join in the celebration of Onondaga's first 50 years by visiting campus, exploring our 50th anniversary website, or attending one of the anniversary-year events. Most importantly, I invite you to play an active role in contributing to OCC's success over the next 50 years.</p>
                      <p>Sincerely,<br />Debbie L. Sydow, Ph.D. President</p>

Recently, within the Respiratory Care program, the model of how studentsí clinical experiences are delivered was extensively revised. This resulted in a more efficient process as well as cost savings, and there was no compromise to the high quality of the studentsí overall clinical experiences.</p>
                      <p class="col1dot5 right quote bg-pale-blue radius-medium">Onondaga's students can earn bachelor's or master's degrees on the Onondaga campus through a regional higher education center at H-1 Hall.</p>
                      <p>Additionally, a review of the Collegeís Master Schedule of Classes was conducted this year to ensure that key classes needed for degree requirements are offered on a consistent basis and at times that were convenient for students. The overall goal is to improve student retention and graduation rates.</p>
                      <h3>Innovative teaching</h3>
                      <p>Onondaga was selected by the prestigious Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching to participate in its Quantway program, which involves eight community colleges nationwide. The collaborative goal is to share best practices to ultimately improve math literacy among community college students. Onondaga was chosen based on the math facultyís innovative approach to math education and their passion for "thinking outside the box" to develop new ways of teaching math to students.</p>
                      <h3>New Programs</h3>
                      <p>The new Computer Forensic Science, A.S. degree trains students for high-demand jobs with local and national organizations including the FBI, CIA, Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security. Transfer agreements are in place with Hilbert College and Utica College to provide a clear pathway for students to pursue careers in cyber security, computer forensics, criminal forensics, information security, data analytics and more.</p>

                      <p>This spring, a groundbreaking for the new Academic II building occurred. When complete, the building will span the campus gorge, connecting Ferrante Hall with the Gordon Student Center. Plans for Academic II appeared in the original Facilities Master Plan for the Onondaga Community College campus in the 1970s. Academic II will feature eight additional smart classrooms and will serve as home to the Music program, which has been in "temporary" space in the Service and Maintenance building in the 1970s and in the Gordon Student Center since the early 1980s.</p>

                      <p>Helping students overcome barriers to success is a key goal of the PowerStart program. Support systems, including a new individual advisement model, are in place for first-year students and include a more robust educational planning component.</p>
                      <p>The PowerStart program also features a ìFirst Year Seminarî and ìFirst Year Advisingî model to assist students from the pre-enrollment stage when they are first considering college options, through their college experience on campus and, finally, to transfer to a four-year college or transition to a career. Also, outreach activities scheduled during the year engage students and help create a more robust Onondaga experience.</p>

                      <p>When financial aid award dollars are received by the College, any outstanding balance owed to the College for tuition, fees and residence halls is subtracted. Any remaining amount can then be released to the student for living expenses. In the last year, more than 18,000 student financial aid transactions were disbursed by the Bursarís office and Financial Services. Of those, 21% were electronic checks.</p>

                      <p>The Collegeís 2012-2016 Strategic Plan provides a clear course of action for institutional growth and advancement in response to local demand. The year-long process of developing the plan incorporated suggestions and feedback from students, employees and partners, as well as an advisory committee consisting of local business and community leaders. The resulting 2011-16 Strategic Plan is a road map that establishes the Collegeís priority goals and investments for the next five years, enhancing student success and fulfilling the Collegeís mission and vision while operating within tight financial constraints.</p>
                      <p>The 2011-16 Strategic Plan focuses on five key areas:</p>
